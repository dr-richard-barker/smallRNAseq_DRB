# smallRNAseq plan A

As we explore different small RNAseq analysis pipelines we start by breaking down the NF_Core small RNAseq pipeline to help us understand how it's working. 
Writing up these early stages are good practice while developing bioinformatics processing pipelines even if they don't make it into the final code.

Initially, the NF_core_smallRNA_pipeline was assessed and then broken down into its different components, (For more information see [smallRNAseq_analysis_pipeline_v1_NF_smRNAseq document](https://github.com/dr-richard-barker/smrRNAseq/blob/main/smallRNAseq_analysis_pipeline_v1_NF_smRNAseq.png))


The document (NF_core_smallRNA_pipeline) holds a summary of the NF_cor_small RNAseq pipeline.
The example commands were created to help test its effect on accuracy using synthetic small RNAseq data from SRA. 


The second document contains instructions for installing and running parts if the NF_smRNAseq workflow.
