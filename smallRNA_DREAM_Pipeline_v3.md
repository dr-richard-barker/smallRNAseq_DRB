**Small RNA-Seq Data Processing Pipeline V3**

**Abstract:** This section outlines a robust workflow for analyzing small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) data, using readily available tools to address quality control, annotation, differential expression, and de novo miRNA discovery. 
By seamlessly integrating mirnaQC, sRNAbench, sRNAde, and mirNOVO, researchers can transform raw NCBI-SRA data into insights about miRNA function and regulation.

**Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:** Identify relevant data sets in NCBI-SRA using GEO accession numbers or keywords.
Download SRA files using the sra-tools toolkit and convert them to FASTQ format with fastq-dump or GeneLab API.
Employ mirnaQC on FASTQ files for adapter trimming, sequence quality analysis, and identification of potential contaminants.

**Annotation and Mapping:** Utilize sRNAbench to annotate known miRNAs based on reference genomes and miRNA databases like miRBase.
Align filtered FASTQ reads to the reference genome and annotated miRNAs using the small RNA mapper like Bowtie.
Generate count tables summarizing read alignments for each annotated miRNA across samples.

**Differential Expression Analysis:** Import count tables into sRNAde for differential expression analysis using robust methods like DESeq2 or edgeR.
Identify statistically significant differences in miRNA expression between experimental groups or treatments.
Visualize differential expression patterns using heat maps, volcano plots, and expression profiles.

**De Novo miRNA Discovery:** Employ mirNOVO on unmapped small RNA reads to identify potential novel miRNAs.
Analyze secondary hairpin structures, flanking genomic regions, and evolutionary conservation within miRNA families.
Validate potential novel miRNAs by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) or other experimental methods.

**To achieve this, we need some additional information:**

**Specific SRA ID:** Replace {sra_id} in the download_sra rule with the actual SRA accession number you want to download.

Sample names: Replace {sample} in all rules with the names of your individual samples (replacements should be consistent across rules).
Custom script for merging tables: Provide the script content for custom_script.py to merge the sRNAbench and mirNOVO outputs. 
This script should parse both files, identify matching miRNAs, and create a merged table with count or expression data for all miRNAs (including novel ones).
Factors table format: Describe the format of your factors.tsv file. Specify the columns and their contents (e.g., sample names, group labels, etc.) to inform sRNAde analysis.
Target gene reference: Specify the filename and format of your target gene reference file (target_genes.fa) needed by sRNAblast.


**Installing mirnaQC**

There are two main ways to install mirnaQC or use their premade webtool (https://arn.ugr.es/mirnaqc/):
**1. Docker:**
This is the recommended method for most users. It ensures you have all necessary dependencies installed without modifying your system environment.
Bash
```
## Install Docker if not already present
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | bash

## Download and run the mirnaQC Docker image
docker run -it --rm arnehackenberg/mirnaqc bash

## Access the web interface in your browser: http://localhost:8080

**2. Python:**
Bash
## Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv env

## Activate the virtual environment
source env/bin/activate

## Install mirnaQC dependencies
pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArneHackenberg/mirnaQC/master/requirements.txt

## Install mirnaQC
pip install mirnaqc

## Run mirnaQC
mirnaqc --help
```

Input Options:

## Snakemate can be used to automate this analysis

**Snakefile Structure:**

**Define Rules:** Start by defining rules for each tool you want to use.
**Define Data Dependencies:** Each rule's input should depend on the output of its predecessor, ensuring proper execution order.
**Customize Scripts:** Replace custom_script.py with your actual script to merge the count tables with novel miRNA annotations.
**Factors and Target Genes:** Ensure the factors.tsv file defines sample grouping for differential expression and adjusts target_genes.fa based on your reference genome.
**Customize Shell Commands:** You may need to adjust shell commands based on specific tool options and desired outputs.

**Running the Snakemake Workflow:**
With everything defined, simply run snakemake in your terminal. 
Snakemake will automatically download data, run tools, parse outputs, and complete the entire analysis pipeline efficiently.
